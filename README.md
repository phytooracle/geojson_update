# Update Information in GeoJSON file

This file takes a GeoJSON and updates the "genotype" and the "year" columns based on the information for a new gantry season. For this task, this notebook requires a GeoJSON from a previous season, as well the latest Gantry FieldBook. 

# Steps to use this Notebook

## Download a previous season's GeoJSON file
Download a previous season's GeoJSON file from cyverse. Try to find a GeoJSON for a season that had the same crop as the crop being grown in the new gantry season. The path to the file looks something like this:
```bash
/iplant/home/shared/phytooracle/season_<X>_sorghum_yr_<YEAR>/level_0/season<X>_multi_latlon_geno_updated.geojson
```
